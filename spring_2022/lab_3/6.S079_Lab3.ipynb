    "The aim of this lab is to implement a complete ML project in python. We will go through the steps of data exploration, cleaning and transformation followed by model training and selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab consists of two parts. The first part is an interactive tutorial adapted from [Aurélien Géron's excellent ML book](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2) with some modifications to make it a classification tutorial instead of a regression one. We will learn to classify neighborhoods by median house value. The tutorial will contains conceptual questions as well as fill-in code that we'll give you a few minutes to write.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of this lab, we expect you to pick any dataset of your own choosing and go through the steps mentioned above. You should try at least 3 different classes of models, and one of them should be an `xgboost` classifier or regressor. We recommend that you pick a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). We will be very flexible in grading this lab; we just need to see that you've taken the right steps. You should submit your notebook to gradescope. Submission instructions will be given on Piazza."
