    "# Lab 5: Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will introduce two popular visualization tools commonly used in python. We will use data from the US Federal Election Commission. The lab will contain live QA and coding that will give you a few minutes to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular plotting libraries today is [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). According to the documentation, \"Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible.\" For the most basic plots, line graphs, single bar plot's etc., matplotlib has functions for just these things.\n",
    "\n",
    "As plots get more complex, many data scientists use [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), a wrapper around matplotlib that improves on its theme, and has convenience functions for more complex plots that tend to be common. You can see a ton of examples in Seaborn's [example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "With Matplotlib and Seaborn you often have to manually move labels, adjust axes, add data labels, etc. An alternative is declarative visualization. Akin to the difference between imperative approaches like Pandas vs declarative approaches like SQL for manipulating tabular data, declarative visualizations allow users to specify what visualization they want over their data by describing the connection between data and visual encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will use a python declarative visualization library, [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/), itself built atop the popular declarative visualization tool [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/), to demonstrate how to get some effective visualizations in relatively few lines of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "While it is difficult to be comprehensive in a short lecture, the idea behind this excercize is to give an introduction to the flavor of some of these tools so that you can try out things on your own later. As usual, useful resource include the documentation and StackOverflow."
